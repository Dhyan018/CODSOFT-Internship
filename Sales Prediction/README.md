# **Sales Prediction Using Python**

This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising and marketing data using machine learning regression techniques.

Sales prediction is an important business problem that helps organizations understand how different factors such as advertising spend influence product demand and revenue.

The objective of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict future sales based on historical data.

## **Dataset**

* Dataset Name: Advertising Dataset

* Source: Provided as part of the project

* Records: Based on available sales data

Features:

* TV Advertising Spend

* Radio Advertising Spend

* Newspaper Advertising Spend

# **Target Variable**

* Sales

Continuous numerical value representing product sales

## **Technologies Used**

* Python

* Jupyter Notebook

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* Scikit-learn

## **Model Evaluation**

The model was evaluated using regression metrics such as:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)

* R² Score

## **Sample Results**

* R² Score: ~90-96%

* Mean Squared Error: Low prediction error = 1.1397

## **Model Testing**

The trained model was tested on unseen data to predict sales based on advertising expenditure inputs.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning regression pipeline, including:

* Data loading

* Exploratory data analysis

* Feature selection

* Model training

* Model evaluation

* Sales prediction

It provides practical insights into how advertising investments impact sales performance and builds a strong foundation for regression-based business analytics.
