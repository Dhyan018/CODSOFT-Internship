# **IMDb Movie Rating Prediction**

This project focuses on predicting the rating of a movie using machine learning regression techniques based on various movie-related features such as genre, director, and actors.

The Movie Rating Prediction problem helps in understanding how different attributes of a movie influence its overall rating given by users or critics.

The objective of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate movie ratings (IMDb) from historical data.

## **Dataset**

*  Dataset Name: Movie Rating Dataset

* Source: Provided as part of the project / historical movie data

* Records: Based on available movie entrie

Features:

* Genre

* Director

* Actors

* Duration

* Votes

* Year

## **Target Variable**

* Rating

Continuous numerical value representing the movie’s rating

## **Technologies Used**

* Python

* Jupyter Notebook

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* Scikit-learn

## **Machine Learning Model Used**

* Regression Model (Linear Regression)

Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection to improve model accuracy.

## **Model Evaluation**

The model was evaluated using regression performance metrics such as:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE): ~0.55

* R² Score: ~0.68

## **Sample Results**

* The model achieved reasonable prediction accuracy

* Demonstrated the impact of movie attributes on ratings

## **Model Testing**

The trained model was tested on unseen movie data to predict ratings based on input features.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning regression workflow, including:

* Data analysis

* Data preprocessing

* Feature engineering

* Model training

* Model evaluation

* Rating prediction

It provides valuable insights into factors affecting movie ratings and builds a strong foundation for regression-based machine learning problems.
