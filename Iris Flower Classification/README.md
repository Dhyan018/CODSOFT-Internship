# **Iris Flower Classification**

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into different species using machine learning techniques based on flower measurements.

The Iris dataset is a classic beginner-friendly dataset widely used in machine learning to understand classification problems.

The model predicts the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal dimensions.

The three species classified in this project are:

* Setosa

* Versicolor

* Virginica

The classification is performed using supervised machine learning algorithms and evaluated using accuracy metrics.
