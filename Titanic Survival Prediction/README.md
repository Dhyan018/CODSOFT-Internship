# **Titanic Survival Prediction**

This project focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques based on passenger information.

The Titanic Survival Prediction problem is a classic beginner-friendly machine learning classification task that helps understand data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

The goal of this project is to classify passengers into:

* Survived

* Not Survived

The prediction is performed using machine learning models trained on passenger-related features.

## **Dataset**

* Dataset: Titanic Dataset

* Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

* Total Records: 891

Features:

* Passenger Class (Pclass)

* Sex

* Age

* Fare

* Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard (SibSp)

* Number of Parents/Children aboard (Parch)

## **Target Variable**

Survived

* 0 → Not Survived

* 1 → Survived

## **Technologies Used**

* Python

* Jupyter Notebook

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

## **Machine Learning Model Used**

* Logistic Regression

Categorical variables were converted into numerical values, and missing values were handled during preprocessing to improve model performance.

## **Model Evaluation**

The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

* Training Accuracy

* Testing Accuracy

* Confusion Matrix

## **Sample Results**

Model Accuracy: ~80% 

The model demonstrates good performance for a beginner-level classification problem.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including:

* Data loading

* Data cleaning and preprocessing

* Feature encoding

* Model training

* Model evaluation

* Prediction

* Scikit-learn
